    <h3>General Note</h3>
    <p>
      Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and the data
      protection provisions of the Confederation (Data Protection Act, DSG<!--DSG-->),
      every person is entitled to the protection of his or her privacy and to
      protection against the misuse of his or her personal data. The operators
      of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously.
      We treat your personal data confidentially and according to the legal data
      protection regulations as well as this data protection declaration.

      In cooperation with our hosting providers, we strive to protect the
      databases as best we can against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or
      destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g.
      communication by e-mail) may be subject to security gaps. A complete
      protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible.

      generally be visited without registration. Data such as pages accessed or
      names of files accessed, date and time are stored on the server for
      statistical purposes, without this data being directly related to your
      person. Personal data, in particular name, address or e-mail address, are
      collected as far as possible on a voluntary basis. No data will be passed
      on to third parties without your consent.

    <h3>Personal data processing</h3>
    <p>

      and procedures used, in particular the storage, disclosure, procurement,
      deletion, storage, alteration, destruction and use of personal data.

    <p>
      We process personal data in accordance with Swiss data protection law. In
      addition, we process personal data in accordance with the following legal
      bases in connection with Art. 6 Para. 1 DSGVO<!--DSGVO-->, to the extent
      and to the extent that the EU Data Protection Act is applicable
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        lit. a) Processing of personal data with the consent of the data
        subject.

        lit. b) Processing of personal data for the performance of a contract
        with the data subject and for the implementation of corresponding
        pre-contractual measures.
      </li>
      <li>
        lit. c) Processing of personal data to fulfil a legal obligation to

      </li>
      <li>
        lit. f) Processing of personal data to protect the legitimate interests
        of us or third parties, unless the fundamental freedoms and rights and

        and compliance with Swiss law.
      </li>

    <p>
      We process personal data for the duration necessary for the purpose or
      purposes in question. In the case of long-term storage obligations due to
      legal and other obligations to which we are subject, we restrict the
      processing accordingly.

    <h3>Privacy statement for tracking companions</h3>
    <p>
      Some apps from schmuckli.dev (for example the 'Tracky Companion') are
      using tracking functions from your device, which are relevant to provide
      new functions in the app. To protect your privacy, we are keeping your
      data save and we will never resell, redistribute or share any of this data
      to other persons and/or organisations.<br />
      With you agreement and consent, we start tracking your location, even when
      in the background, when the app is closed and not in use. You can always
      stop the tracking, by stopping the tracking feature in the app itself,
      completly stopp the app as a process in the system settings or uninstall
      it from your device. In order to process the raw tracking data, we upload
      your data to our servers. The data transfer is always safely encrypted via
      HTTPS and using the latest security patterns to protect your data from
      foreign attacks.

    <h3>Third party services</h3>
    <p>
      This website may use Google Maps for embedding maps, Google Invisible
      reCAPTCHA for protection against bots and spam and YouTube for embedding
      videos.
    </p>
    <p>
      These services of the American Google LLC use among other things Cookies
      and consequently data are transferred to Google in the USA, whereby we
      assume that in this context no person-referred Tracking takes place alone
      by the use of our Website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Google is committed to ensuring adequate data protection in accordance
      with the American-European and American-Swiss Privacy Shields.

    <h3>Note regarding data transfers to the USA (United States)</h3>
    <p>
      For reasons of completeness, we draw your attention to the fact that users
      domiciled in Switzerland are subject to surveillance measures by US
      authorities which generally permit the storage of all personal data from
      Switzerland which has been transmitted to the USA.
    </p>
    <p>
      This shall be done without differentiation, limitation or exception on the
      basis of the objectives pursued and without any objective criterion that
      would allow US authorities' access to and subsequent use of the data to be
      limited to very specific, strictly limited purposes that could justify
      access to and intrusion into the data. We also draw your attention to the
      fact that in the USA there are no legal remedies available to the persons
      concerned from Switzerland which would allow them to gain access to the
      data concerning them and to obtain its correction or cancellation, or no
      effective legal protection against general access rights of US
      authorities. We explicitly draw the attention of those concerned to this
      legal and factual situation in order to make an informed decision to
      consent to the use of their data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users residing in an EU Member State<!--EU-->
      we would like to point out that, from the point of view of the European
      Union, the USA does not have an adequate level of data protection.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Ammendations</h3>
    <p>
      We may amend this privacy statement at any time without prior notice. The
      current version published on our website shall apply. If the data
      protection declaration is part of an agreement with you, we will inform
      you in the event of an update about the change by e-mail or in another
      suitable way.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Questions to the Data Protection Officer</h3>
    <p>
      If you have any questions about data protection, please send us an e-mail
      or contact the person responsible for data protection in our organisation
      listed at the beginning of the data protection declaration.
